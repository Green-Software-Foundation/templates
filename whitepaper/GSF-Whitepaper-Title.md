## Scope

```
Define as it relates to Green Software Foundation Activity. If it adds clarity, define what is not in the scope. DELETE THIS COMMENT 
```

## References

```
The policy for reference lists is:
1. GSF documents listed should have at least one approved version – draft-only docs should not be referenced.
An exception exists for documents approved with or after the referenced doc is approved (maybe part of the same enabler package). In short – approved docs should not reference unapproved docs.
2. References to other affiliate docs should similarly provide sufficient information to uniquely determine the needed document and should provide the appropriate source information.
3. The URL for GSF material (new GSF and affiliate) should always be http://www.greensoftware.foundation
    
Models to use:
	[REFLABEL]	<General Model> "Ref Title", Ref information (source, date, id), URL:http//<ref-source>/ 
	[GSFDOC]	<GSF Model> "GSF Document Title",{ Version x.y,} Green Software Foundation™, GSF <docname>{    <version>}, URL:http//www.openmobilealliance.org/ 

If there are no entries in the table – enter 'none' to be clear.
